OS: Linux Ubuntu
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Language: Python 3

Libraries/Packages used: nltk, re, language_tool_python, pycorenlp, fileinput, statistics, csv, numpy, sklearn

These packages must be installed before running the code. Since the package pycorenlp is used, using the terminal, a connection must be established to the Stanford server (StanfordCoreNLP, 9000 is default).

Important files: 

report (ex: 2019-calculus-RR03-0499.txt or any other report)

rubric (ex: pendulum_rubric.txt)

If using csv: results.csv (which includes both the report and the score [0-5])

For the language_tool_python, the output leads to a url, which is not required. It shows all the matches or errors in language (ex: spelling mistake) found and reports possible replacements and where the error occured. Might be a bit slow when running the first time.

If all the requirements above are met, the function or the features can be tested and the code should run properly.
